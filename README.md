A simple game shows how a low‑power ultralight climber can move up a vibrating tether all the way to space using non‑contact eddy‑current grabbing. Selectable tether‑vibration shapes: sine, square, sawtooth.

Background
Tether vibrations allow distributed power delivery to multiple ultralight climbers (space monkeys) simultaneously. Waste heat is generated inside the tether from eddy currents and radiated to space at –206 °C. The game mostly takes place in the atmosphere, but the actual trip to GEO (geostationary Earth orbit) is 99.9 % in the cold of space.

The current built prototype weighs 500 g and has been tested up to 100 kph.
Next step: 200 kph and climber generates electricity from momentum, sacrificing 10 % of speed to allow 24/7 operation with a minimal battery backup.

Design Guidelines
Climber has no moving parts for reliability in extreme environments at speeds up to 1000 kph.
Climber must not damage the tether (no mechanical contact, hot spots, sparks).
Climber must not block the tether (failure triggers a passive release system).
Climmer must not heat the tether above 450 °C (graphene oxidation threshold).
Climber must not start or stop on the tether (accelerate to cruise speed before attachment).

Idea is based on the work of Blaise Gassend, Ph.D.
