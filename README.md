A silly Space Monkey game based on https://neal.fun/
Shows how a low power ultralight climber can move up a vibrating tether all the way to space.

Designe Guidelines to Protect Tether:
- Climber Must NOT damage tether (no mechanical contact, excessive heating, or sparks)
- Climber Must NOT block tether (failure triggers passive release system)
- Climber Must NOT heat tether above 450°C (graphene oxidation threshold)
- Climber Must NOT start or stop on tether (accelerate to cruise speed  before attachment)
