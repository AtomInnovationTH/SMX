A silly Space Monkey game based on https://neal.fun/

Shows how a low power ultralight climber can move up a vibrating tether all the way to space by non-contact grabbing with eddy currents.

Tether vibrations allow distributed power delivery across multiple ultralight climbers simultaneously. Waste heat is generated inside tether from eddy currents and radiated to space at -206°C, the trip to GEO is 99.9% in the cold of space. Climber generates electricity from momentum, sacrificing 10% of speed/cargo to allow 24/7 operation with only minimal battery backup.

Designe Guidelines to Protect Tether:
- Climber Must NOT damage tether (no mechanical contact, hot spots, sparks)
- Climber Must NOT block tether (failure triggers passive release system)
- Climber Must NOT heat tether above 450°C (graphene oxidation threshold)
- Climber Must NOT start or stop on tether (accelerate to cruise speed before attachment)

Actually prototype is 500 grams and tested up to 100 kph
