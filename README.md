A silly Space Monkey game.

click to play: https://atominnovationth.github.io/SMX/

Simple game shows how a low power ultralight climber can move up a vibrating tether all the way to space by non-contact grabbing with eddy currents.  Selectable tether vibration shapes: sine, square, sawtooth.

Backround: Tether vibrations allow distributed power delivery to multiple ultralight climbers (space monkeys) simultaneously. Waste heat is generated inside tether from eddy currents and radiated to space at -206°C.  The game is mostly in the atmosphere, but the actually trip to GEO is 99.9% in the cold of space. Climber generates electricity from momentum, sacrificing 10% of speed/cargo to allow 24/7 operation with only minimal battery backup.

Actually prototype is 500 grams and tested up to 100 kph

Design Guidelines to Protect Tether:
- Climber Must NOT damage tether (no mechanical contact, hot spots, sparks)
- Climber Must NOT block tether (failure triggers passive release system)
- Climber Must NOT heat tether above 450°C (graphene oxidation threshold)
- Climber Must NOT start or stop on tether (accelerate to cruise speed before attachment)



Idea is based on the work of Blaise Gassend, PhD
